    </div>

    I am a movie, series and anime guy. I enjoy watching movies a lot and particularly those with action, sci-fi, animation and comedy genre. Not really a fan of drama and romance. So, if im indoors that will basically be what ill be doing along with some snacks during my free time. I also enjoy a bunch of other things such as gaming, cycling and playing table tennis ( was a champ back in high school ). Cycling and table tennis are basically the sports I enjoy.
