Well I had various reasons for choosing this course and the major reason was because automation is taking over the world. I mean, look around; you got smart machines every where now. I want to be a part of that. Another reason was because of my interest in programming. Well in that aspect, I was pretty unstable for a while. I really liked programming but also loved little machines and robots and the fact that mechatronics pretty much combines them both was absolutely amazing. Well enough talk about this.
