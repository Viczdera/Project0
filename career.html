    <h1>CAREER PATH</h1>
    I am currently a student engineer aspiring to become a mechatronics engineer. I study at----------------.
  <p id="more1"> Well I had various reasons for choosing this course and the major reason was because automation is taking over the world. I mean, look around; you got smart machines every where now. I want to be a part of that. Another reason was because of my interest in programming. Well in that aspect, I was pretty unstable for a while. I really liked programming but also loved little machines and robots and the fact that mechatronics pretty much combines them both was absolutely amazing. Well enough talk about this. Here are my <a href="interests.html">interests.</a>
